# The web app that will make you live experiences around the world!

Welcome to the repository of this project made by Juvixa Loayza and Ranier Mujica as part of the full stack web development Bootcamp at Ironhack.

## Applied technologies

The web application is built with a server developed entirely with JavaScript, NodeJs, Express, MongoDB and Cloudinary. While we have worked with React, CSS and Bootstrap to develop views from the client.

### MVP

Our MVP consists of an application where through token technology a user can register and access the web to view experiences around the world (in test phase only in Spain) and meet the creators of these experiences, book and add to their favourites. Similarly, by accessing the "Itinerary" area, users can organise their next trip and add the experiences of their choice.

You can also log in as an administrator and upload your own experiences that you want to share with other travellers. Adding photos, itinerary and activities to do. 


### Improvements

The MVP presents the basic functions for logging in, browsing the experiences available in each city, visiting the details of each experience and adding to favourites. The option to create a new itinerary is also available. Aspects such as layout, itinerary editing and profile editing functions need to be improved.
